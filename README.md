# RocketSlides

![Rocketslides](tmp/rocket.png)

Reveal.js powered web app for presentations. 

***Currently just started so nothing special as of now.***

### Goals
- Dynamic slide template
- Real-time slide control
- Access management 
- Control Slideshow from Mobile Phone
- Maybe static markdown files are a good idea. Thinking of way to integrate


### Long Term Goals
- Multiple slideshow support. This is complicated but it's one big ship running a single slide. Alternate shows would be great. Though possible but you'll need to create separate rooms for your slide 
- Interactive stuffs maybe. Since users can access it on their laptop or mobile phones


## License

I'm not much of a formal person but you're free to use this for any projects either commercial or non-commercial purposes. I'm not a lawyer or a patent office by the way so this isn't actually an issued license.
